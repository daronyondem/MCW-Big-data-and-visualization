# Big data and visualization hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

This hands-on lab is designed to provide exposure to many of Microsoft's transformative line of business applications built using Microsoft big data and advanced analytics.

By the end of the lab, you will be able to show an end-to-end solution, leveraging many of these technologies but not necessarily doing work in every component possible.

## Overview

Margie's Travel (MT) provides concierge services for business travelers. In an increasingly crowded market, they are always looking for ways to differentiate themselves and provide added value to their corporate customers.

They are looking to pilot a web app that their internal customer service agents can use to provide additional information useful to the traveler during the flight booking process. They want to enable their agents to enter in the flight information and produce a prediction as to whether the departing flight will encounter a 15-minute or longer delay, considering the weather forecast for the departure hour.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The high-level overview diagram of the end-to-end solution is displayed. Flight delay data and historical airport weather data are provided to Azure Data Factory. Azure Data Factory provides this data to both blob storage and Azure Databricks. Azure Databricks scores the data and saves the results to an Azure SQL Database. Azure Databricks also creates, trains, and exports a machine learning model to the Azure Machine Learning Service. Azure Machine Learning service provides a containerized services that is consumed by the web portal. The web portal also consumes 3rd party API data for forecasted weather. Map data visualization is provided by Power BI using web portal information and the Azure SQL database.](../Whiteboard%20design%20session/media/high-level-overview.png 'High-level overview diagram')

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will not work.

2. If you are not a Service Administrator or Co-administrator for the Azure subscription, or if you are running the lab in a hosted environment, you will need to install [Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the **ASP.NET and web development** and **Azure development** workloads.

3. Follow all the steps provided in [Before the Hands-on Lab](Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Big%20data%20and%20visualization.md).

## Exercise 1: Retrieve lab environment information and create Databricks cluster

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will retrieve your Azure Storage account name and access key and your Azure Subscription Id and record the values to use later within the lab. You will also create a new Azure Databricks cluster.

### Task 1: Retrieve Azure Storage account information and Subscription Id

You will need to have the Azure Storage account name and access key when you create your Azure Databricks cluster during the lab. You will also need to create storage containers in which you will store your flight and weather data files.

1. From the side menu in the Azure portal, choose **Resource groups**, then enter your resource group name into the filter box, and select it from the list.

2. Next, select your lab Azure Storage account from the list.

   ![The lab Azure Storage account is selected from within your lab resource group.](media/select-azure-storage-account.png 'Azure Storage Account')

3. On the left menu, select **Overview (1)**, locate and copy your Azure **Subscription ID (2)** and save to a text editor such as Notepad for later use.

## Exercise 8: Deploy intelligent web app (Optional Lab)

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy an intelligent web application to Azure from GitHub. This application leverages the operationalized machine learning model deployed in Exercise 1 to bring action-oriented insight into an already existing business process.

> **Please note**: If you are running your lab in a hosted Azure environment and do not have permissions to create a new Azure resource group, the automated deployment task (#2 below) may fail, even if you choose an existing resource group. The automated deployment will also fail if the user you are logged into the portal with is **not** a Service Administrator or a Co-Administrator. If this happens, we recommend that you install [Visual Studio 2017/2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or greater, then use the [Publish feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/deployment/quickstart-deploy-to-azure?view=vs-2019) to publish to a new Azure web app. You will then need to create and populate two new Application Settings as outlined in the tasks that follow: `mlUrl` and `weatherApiKey`. **Skip ahead to Task 3 for further instructions.**

### Task 1: Register for an OpenWeather account

To retrieve the 5-day hourly weather forecast, you will use an API from OpenWeather. There is a free version that provides you access to the API you need for this hands-on lab.

1. Navigate to <https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_up>.

2. Complete the registration form by providing your desired username, email address, and a password. Verify you are 16 years old and over, and agree to the privacy policy and terms of conditions. Select **Create Account**. If you already have an account, select **Sign in** at the top of the page instead.

   ![The registration form is displayed.](media/openweather-register.png "Create New Account")

3. Check your email account you used for registration. You should have a confirmation email from OpenWeather. Open the email and follow the email verification link within to complete the registration process. When the welcome page loads, log in with your new account.

   ![The OpenWeather confirmation and account login page is displayed.](media/openweather-confirmation-login.png "Sign In To Your Account")

4. After logging in, select the **API keys** tab. Take note of your Default **Key** and copy it to a text editor such as Notepad for later. You will need this key to make API calls later in the lab.

   - Ensure the correct Directory and Subscription are selected.

   - Select the Resource Group **(1)** that you have been using throughout this lab.

   - Either keep the default Site name, or provide one that is globally unique, and then choose a Site Location.

   - Enter the **OpenWeather API Key (3)**.

   - Finally, enter the **ML URL (3)**. We got this from Azure databricks Notebook #3 in the Exercise 2 folder. If you cleaned your resources at the end of this Notebook #3, you will need to re-run it and keep the web service running to get its associated URL.

      ![The web service URL is output from a cell within the Databricks notebook.](media/azure-databricks-web-url.png 'Web service URL')

   ![Fields on the Deploy to Azure page are populated with the previously copied information.](media/azure-deployment-form.png 'Deploy to Azure page')

5. Select **Review + create (4)**, and on the following screen, select **Create**.

6. The page should begin deploying your application while showing you a status of what is currently happening.

   > **Note**: If you run into errors during the deployment that indicate a bad request or unauthorized, verify that the user you are logged into the portal with an account that is either a Service Administrator or a Co-Administrator. You won't have permissions to deploy the website otherwise.

7. After a short time, the deployment will complete, and you will be able to access the web site.

8. Try a few different combinations of origin, destination, date, and time in the application. The information you are shown is the result of both the ML API you published, as well as information retrieved from the OpenWeather API.
